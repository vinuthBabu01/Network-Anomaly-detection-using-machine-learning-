# Network Anomaly detection using machine learning 
Data set 
AWID(Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion dataset)

https://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/awid2

AWID-CLS-R-Trn - Training dataset

AWID-CLS-R-Tst - Testing dataset

Dataset can be downloaded from the mentioned website(https://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/awid2)

Requirements:

Jupyter Notebook

Python 3.8

Visual studio code

1. AWID dataset is pre-processed and analysed using a machine learning algorithm
2. Injection, Impersonation and normal datasets are classified and detected using machine learning algorithms(decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic regression)
