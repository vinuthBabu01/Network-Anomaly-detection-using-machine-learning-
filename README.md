# Network Anomaly detection using machine learning 
Data set 
AWID(Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion dataset)
https://icsdweb.aegean.gr/awid/awid2
AWID-CLS-R-Trn - Training dataset
AWID-CLS-R-Tst - Testing dataset
Can download the dataset from above mentioned website. 

Requirements
Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.8
Visual studio code

1. AWID dataset is pre-processed and analysed using a machine learning algorithm
2. Injection, Impersonation and normal datasets are classified and detected using machine learning algorithms(decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Logistic regression)
